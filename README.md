A fantasy Magic system based on Quantum Mechanics
## [Excerpted from Whatsapp]

Considering the current information age has risen from such simple a information theory concept as encoding any information as either a 0 or 1; I wonder whether it's possible to create a fictional magic theory based on quantum mechanics starting with such fundamental concepts as quantum superposition

I believe the key first step to a working magic theory is linking mind to matter using a convincing principle/concept.

Quantum superposition neatly provides half of the solution. It basically says that everything is a wave until the act of observation/measurement collapses the wave hence revealing the actual thing. If you stretch this interpretation it means that matter can be rearranged to any desired structure/order; anything can be made out of nothing.

The other half of the solution is provided by the theoretical physics concept of the observer. Depending on the interpretation of quantum mechanics you ascribe to, the intelligent observer is fundamental in shaping reality. In the infamous double slit experiment it is the observer that dictates whether light behaves as a particle or as a wave. 

Intelligent observers have brains. The thought process produces brainwaves. As we have already seen, Everything is a wave 'potential'. This means that brainwaves can manipulate the 'potential' quantum waves to dictate the outcome in reality.

Quantum Mechanics  (superposition) + Observer Effect = Magic

About reality only being true the observer. Its possible to tweak the theory to allow of 'fundamental objective reality' explaining prexisting things that are subject to the classical laws of physics and energy while magic being the subjective force that rearranges reality.

'Zero Point Energy' as the energy that makes all this possible.

[Quantum Mechanics  (superposition) + Observer Effect] Ã— ZPE = Magic

the Observer's brain waves interacting with the quantum wave equation before collapse.

the observer intentionally collapses the wave function

there's some kind of meta shit going on with the observers brain waves pre observation that induce collapse and thus observation

the wave equation is one of the major theoretical foundations initiate Observers (that's what quantum magic practitioners are called) have to grasp. In essence it shows that everything in reality is a system of interacting forces with a precise configuration. Observers must learn to visualize any system (spell) thay want to collapse (cast).

The basic system everyone learns in Quantum Optics class is the laser . Observers must visualize gradually adding energy(ZPE) to a groups of atoms so that electrons are liberated from their energy levels. Once the desired intensity is reached, all the accumulated energy in the liberated electrons is released in an instant leading to a high intensity colored beam of light.

What is cool is that everyone has a unique laser color. Furthermore, intially the laser is a weak light show that can serve as a light source or entertainment but with practice and greater understanding of the system it evolves into an extremely powerful weapon analogous to Balefire or Darkseid's Omega beams.
